# Streetwave-Project

Note that this was a direct pull from the university GitLab. A large amount of project history has not come through. I haven't modified anything.

Also note that I do not claim to of worked solely on this project as I was part of a larger team of 4. Important areas that are either solely or close to solely my contribution are:

- The Vodafone Scraper
- The Dockerfile + deployment files. 
- Most of the frontend filters section. 

There was a large amount of paired programming and bugfixing in this project; if you seek a more detailed rundown I highly reccomend you contact me for my dissertation write-up.
